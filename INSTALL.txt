Installation
============

Installing an official release
------------------------------

Official releases are made available from
http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/

Remember run the command ``manage.py syncdb`` after installation

Source distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the .zip distribution file and unpack it. Inside is a script
named ``setup.py``. Enter this command::

   python setup.py install

...and the package will install automatically.



Windows installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Windows installer is also made available - download the .exe
distribution file and launch it to install the application.

An uninstaller will also be created, accessible through Add/Remove
Programs in your Control Panel.

Installing the development version
----------------------------------

Alternatively, if you'd like to update Django Tagging occasionally to pick
up the latest bug fixes and enhancements before they make it into an
official release, perform a `Subversion`_ checkout instead. The following
command will check the application's development branch out to an
``tagging-trunk`` directory::

   svn checkout http://django-tagging.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tagging-trunk

Add the resulting folder to your `PYTHONPATH`_ or symlink (`junction`_,
if you're on Windows) the ``tagging`` directory inside it into a
directory which is on your PYTHONPATH, such as your Python
installation's ``site-packages`` directory.

You can verify that the application is available on your PYTHONPATH by
opening a Python interpreter and entering the following commands::

   >>> import tagging
   >>> tagging.VERSION
   (0, 3, 'pre')



Once you've installed Django Tagging and want to use it in your Django
applications, do the following:

   1. Put ``'tagging'`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
   2. Run the command ``manage.py syncdb``.

The ``syncdb`` command creates the necessary database tables and
creates permission objects for all installed apps that need them.

That's it!
